   <p>COLLECTIVE AUTHORSHIP</p>

   <p>In an attempt to greater understand the underlying currents within the larger network context, companies have begun to develop algorithms with the ability to quickly compile and relate information to observe trends. These algorithms operate within simple rulesets, valuing quantitative analysis over qualitative observation to develop relationships. Such processes include anomaly detection, cluster detection, classification, association learning, and even regression (prediction based on past habits). These algorithms have the potential ability to read the overall impacts of networked authorship, avoiding the overwhelming number of isolated occurrences. This networked authorship can be seen as a collection of individual authors. Ranging from individuals as people, devices, and sensors, data is created and collected into a complex matrix. Data, users, devices, all coalesce to create a field of multiplicity and redundancy. This system differs from the common understanding of the network as an organized logic. Instead, it can be characterized by its scrappy, ad-hoc nature that is only made clear through the use of organizational algorithms.</p>

   <p>As a collection of disparate individuals, there is more potential for individual creation and customization than ever before. A main characteristic of network culture, self-curation and the development of a highly personalized experience have become more attainable than ever before. Catering to our personal desires to be acknowledged, we constantly receive feedback through the network from our actions, and are impacted by the actions of others. Now, niche interests can be developed and promoted through the bottom-up creation. Unique perspectives and presentations take on unprecedented level of power, as they can now be viewed, shared, and debated within the network. Production within the network is also one of its most powerful qualities. Content is uploaded, shared, edited, re-mixed, undergoing a constant translation as it moves throughout the system. The content on websites such as Wikipedia allow for the coalescing of a collective production that is the result of a combinatory authorship.</p>
   <p>This collective authorship happens at a wide range of scales, from personal curation to larger global movements, If architecture had the ability to condense and organize these ranging hierarchies of information flows, it could then generate spatial affect based on these determined results. Architecture could use these algorithms to create environmental responses and enhanced experience. This would happen through a spatial translation from the digital to the physical, working within accepted architectural elements, but subverting their understanding through transformation. Spaces would operate within different modes, creating environments that embody the understandings from personal and global happenings within virtual space. By overlaying these effects, a virtual architecture would be crated, one authored by the network and in a sense becoming a condensed network of affects itself. This would lead to the development of heterogeneous, personalized space, with the ability for outside influence and impact.</p>

   <p>Architecture has the potential to become a filter of the data flows of the network, a physical translator of spatial effects. Using overlaid systems with the ability to operate on different prescribed paradigms, architecture could begin to react to different hierarchies of inputs, from environmental conditions and local transformations to information and global issues that disperse contextual relationships. Architecture has the responsibility of no longer addressing just the local contextual conditions but also the global issues that are experienced and occur every day.</p>
   <p>These reactive devices would need to be embedded within the existing architectural typologies that are already understood, transforming them into dynamic spatial activators. Using these overlaid systems to create a multiplicity of affect flows that work simultaneously in a rhythm, operating in consistent mediation. This new typology of architecture becomes a morphed and distorted version of pre-existing notions, not a complete reinterpretation of architectural environment.</p>

   <p>To avoid the pressing issue of technology and its nature of appliqué within architecture, these devices must be fused as mechanical and dynamic systems that have large scale architectural implications through their use. Ephemeral and phenomenological experiences would need to be produced through their operations. Operating through physical and material methods, using “dumb” technologies in order to not drift into a realm of surface expression.</p>

   <p>These transformations create value in their ability to drastically change the spatial environment of the architecture. Views, light, scale, circulation, programmatic relationships, all with the abilities to change and shift with the flows of translated information, and all with large implications on the experience. The affects become ubiquitous and dispersed, enveloping and at some points rupturing, adding up to a multiplicity of affects. This constant dialogue develops an ambiguous nature for the architecture, a de-authored massing that has no single formal resolution. Mario Carpo proposes this new digital style as one of redundancy and ricketiness. Deconstructed, layered systems,components, some points hidden and at others revealed. This architecture is not a single kinetic machine but layered generators of affect to develop heterogeneous experience.</p>
